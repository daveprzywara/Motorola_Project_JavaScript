# Motorola_Project_JavaScript by Dave Przywara
Prototype of geocaching portal in JavaScript - frontend

To properly launch the website you need to put your own Google's <b>API_KEY</b> in index.html.
<script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap">
    </script>
   </br>   
First page is just an intro.</br>
Second page is a heart of this website.</br>
There is a map (Google API).</br>
User is allowed to add new marker on the map, by clicking the exact place on the map or by typing position in 'Add object'.</br>
User is allowed to read title, description, position and author of exact marker and also add new one.</br>
User is allowed to edit and remove marker.</br></br>

Third page shows divs with description(etc.), which are dynamically created after marker.
